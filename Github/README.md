## Github Desktop Tutorial

Git facilitates version control and collaboration. Uploading things on a Github repo also makes it easy to store and generate links to picture files that you would like to display in your online experiments in case you can't sign up for your own server (videos and audios won't work). If you have a separate server that can store experimental data, you can also host html/javascript-based experiments on Github.

# Create links to images

* You first need to enable/publish Github pages 
* You can do so by: Settings &rarr; (Scroll down to Github pages) &rarr; Source: master branch
* Link address to your site will be provided, with the announcement: Your site is published at: (link address)
* The link to the repository will be something like: github.com/sunwooj/reponame
* The link to the corresponding pages/site will be something like: sunwooj.github.io/reponame
* The correct link addresses to your pictures will be the latter type of address, with the specification of the appropriate sub-folder (if applicable) and file name; e.g., sunwooj.github.io/reponame/images/sleep-all.png
